# startup success prediction
The Startup Success Prediction System is a Machine Learning–based web application that predicts whether a startup is likely to succeed (Acquired) or fail (Closed) using historical business data.
This project integrates a trained Random Forest classification model with a Flask web framework to provide an interactive interface where users can enter startup details and receive predictions instantly.
The system not only provides the prediction result but also displays the probability of success and visual insights such as feature graphs, SHAP explanations, and confusion matrix analysis to improve interpretability.
